### Overview

For this exercise, please refer to the following meerkat users.

``` javascript
    {Name: "Aleksandr", Age: 30},
    {Name: "Auto Sergei", Age:77},
    {Name: "Maiya", Age: 25},
    {Name: "Oleg", Age: 5},
    {Name: "Hannah", Age: 20}
```

This exercise is split into multiple steps.  
Each step will require you to add or extract some information from the Meerkats dataset and print it on the console.

### Step 1
Create a new Class with the above list of Meerkats, and print it to the console
Example output:
```
{"Name":"Aleksandr","Age":30}
{"Name":"Auto Sergei","Age":77}
{"Name":"Maiya","Age":25}
{"Name":"Oleg","Age":5}
{"Name":"Hannah","Age":20}
```

### Step 2
Remove from the list any Meerkat who is under the age of 10.  
Example output:  
```
{"Name":"Aleksandr","Age":30}
{"Name":"Auto Sergei","Age":77}
{"Name":"Maiya","Age":25}
{"Name":"Hannah","Age":20}
```

### Step 3
Add up the total age of all the meerkats in the list.  
Example output:   
```
152
```

### Step 4
Add a new meerkat as the 4th meerkat in the list.  
Example output:   
```
{"Name":"Aleksandr","Age":30}
{"Name":"Auto Sergei","Age":77}
{"Name":"Maiya","Age":25}
{"Name":"My new meerkat","Age":30}
{"Name":"Hannah","Age":20}
```

### Step 5
Sort the Meerkats in descending order by Age.  
Example output:   
```  
{"Name":"Auto Sergei","Age":77}
{"Name":"Aleksandr","Age":30}
{"Name":"My new meerkat","Age":30}
{"Name":"Maiya","Age":25}
{"Name":"Hannah","Age":20}
```

### Step 6
List the name of any Meerkat whose name is a Palindrome.  
[Here](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/palindrome-examples.html) is a list of palindromes to assist.  

Example output:  
```
hannah
```

### Step 7
Group the Meerkats by Age.  
Example output:  
```
[{"Name":"Auto Sergei","Age":77}]
[{"Name":"Aleksandr","Age":30},{"Name":"My new meerkat","Age":30}]
[{"Name":"Maiya","Age":25}]
[{"Name":"Hannah","Age":20}]
```

### Step 8

Find the Factorial of Baby Olegs age.
* For example Oleg is 5.  The factorial of 5 is 120.
* It is calculated by multiplying 5 with 4 and its result with 3 and its result with 2, and its result with 1    
Example output:  
```
120
```
